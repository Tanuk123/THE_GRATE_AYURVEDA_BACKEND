Arthritis,"Pain, Stiffness ,Swelling ,Redness,Decreased range of motion . There are 2 type of arthristis 1. Osteoarthritis -> The most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to a joint's cartilage — the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones where they form a joint. Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows nearly frictionless joint motion, but enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection. 2. Rheumatoid arthritis ->In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining (synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint.","Manage your weight,Get enough exercise, Use hot and cold therapy, Try acupuncture,
